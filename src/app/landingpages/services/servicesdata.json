      "name": "Botox",
      "details": "Botox: Botox is an injected neuromodulator that works by relaxing nerve-muscle imbalance. Botulinum toxin type A, specifically OnabotulinumtoxinA, is used to paralyze muscle momentarily. This lessens the effect of wrinkles on the face. Botox can elevate the corners of the mouth that sag with age, smooth out the pincushion look in some chins, and lessen vertical neck cords, in addition to smoothing frown lines between the eyebrows. Patients can benefit from BOTOX in a variety of ways such as preventing excessive sweating. The neurons that activate sweat glands are restricted from signaling the glands to sweat. Also, it is considered to be a safe procedure for minimizing wrinkles and facial lines. The expert BOTOX injectors at DMB are certified and highly experienced in the most productive techniques of injection.
